# My-QMK-Keymap

QMK C code for my keyboard firmware.

Notable features:

Holding down Caps Lock or Menu button activates a new layer with function keys, arrow keys, and more. Lighting also changes to soft strobe.

Holding down Enter and pressing one of the keys in the bottom left activates a certain layer:
  1. Normal Input (Orange Lighting)
  2. Numpad (Green Lighting)
  3. Japanese (Red Lighting)
  4. Keyboard Settings (All Colors Lighting)
